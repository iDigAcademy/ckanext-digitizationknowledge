        <h2 class="mb-4 pb-2 border-bottom border-3 border-primary d-inline-block">About the Digitization Knowledge Base</h2>
        <p class="fs-5">The Digitization Knowledge Base, a project of Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio), is a central hub for discovering resources related to the digitization of biodiversity collections. We serve a wide spectrum of users, from museum professionals and researchers to those engaged in participatory science. Our mission is to enhance the visibility of these valuable resources and make it easier to identify and fill gaps in community documentation.</p>

      <!-- Justification - Our Story Section -->
      <section class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="mb-4 pb-2 border-bottom border-3 border-primary d-inline-block">Our Story</h2>
        <p>For years, iDigBio has supported the biodiversity digitization community by curating resources on the iDigBio Wiki. While these pages have been an important reference for collection professionals, the community found that searching for and discovering new materials on the wiki could be cumbersome.</p>
        <p>The Digitization Knowledge Base was born from this feedback. It represents the next evolution in iDigBio's commitment to compiling and sharing community knowledge, offering a powerful and intuitive experience for all users.</p>

      <!-- Our Approach Section -->
      <section class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="mb-4 pb-2 border-bottom border-3 border-primary d-inline-block">Our Approach</h2>
        <p>Our approach is to serve as a central hub that points to the wealth of resources already created by the digitization community, rather than hosting original content directly. We enrich these resources with detailed descriptions and structured metadata to power a robust search experience, allowing users to find materials through both faceted and full-text searches. This focus on metadata enhancement makes discovery faster and more intuitive. Furthermore, we foster a collaborative environment by enabling community discussion around each resource through a commenting system, helping to collectively advance our shared expertise.</p>

                Not entirely. This platform is complementary to the iDigBio Wiki. It is designed to replace the wiki's function as a list of resources by offering a much more powerful search experience. The wiki will remain a valuable source for original, long-form content and articles created by the community.

                Definetively! While our team currently curates the resources, we welcome suggestions. The best way to propose a new resource is by creating an issue in our DigitizationKnowledge GitHub repository.
